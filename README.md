Predicting Diamond Prices via an interactive web interface
================
This interactive interface for a linear regression model predictor was built in August 2014 as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialisation '9. Data Products' class. 

This repo contains the source files for the Shiny App found at http://rpadawan.shinyapps.io/diamonds

This repo also contains the write up (motivation and data description) for this project. The report can be read here http://ryounglingpadawan.github.io/diamondsshinyapp/index.html

The R Shiny app files are the server.R and the ui.R files. Everything else here goes towards buiding the Slidify R HTML presentation.
